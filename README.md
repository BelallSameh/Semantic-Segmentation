# Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning 🧠🎨

Welcome to the **Semantic Segmentation** project! This repository contains code and models for performing semantic segmentation on the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, making it a great resource for those interested in deep learning and computer vision. 🚀

## 📜 Overview

Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image into a predefined set of classes. This project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately segment images from the Cityscapes dataset, which contains high-quality images of urban scenes.

## ✨ Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes dataset.
- **Easy to Use**: Well-documented code and clear instructions.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy to extend and customize.
- **Pretrained Models**: Use our pretrained models for quick results.
